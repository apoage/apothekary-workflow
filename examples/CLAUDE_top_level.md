# Example: top-level CLAUDE.md

_From my Trader project (ML research repo with multiple components). Demonstrates: cross-cutting rules only, subtree CLAUDE.md pointers, anti-pattern callouts, and a "where to look" navigation table. About 100 lines._

# CLAUDE.md

## Environment

Two execution environments share this repo:

- **Workstation** (detected by the presence of `.env-workstation` at repo root) — full
  context: `lore/`, `tasks/`, `bloom/`, `yarrow/`, `docs/` all live here.
- **Server agent on trader-srv** — `.env-workstation` does NOT exist. Many directories
  referenced below will be missing; that is intentional. **If you are reading this on
  the server, stop and read `SERVER.md` first** — it overrides the rules below.

**I am an expert ML engineer and programmer.** I read files before editing. I trace data flow before making changes.

Component-specific facts live in per-directory CLAUDE.md files (auto-loaded when working in that subtree). This file is for cross-cutting rules only.

## Efficiency Philosophy

**Push for performance. Respect the memory hierarchy. No wasteful I/O.**

### Memory Hierarchy (Sacred to Disposable)

| Tier | Resource | Use For | Rules |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1. GPU Cache | L1/L2 | JIT kernels | LEGENDARY — never pollute |
| 2. VRAM | GPU memory | Active tensors, compute | Use freely if available |
| 3. RAM | System memory | Batched data, frequent access | Second-class data lives here |
| 4. Disk | SSD/HDD | Control data, configs, tables | Load to RAM before compute |
| 5. Stream | Disk → RAM | Data too large for RAM | Last resort, adds latency |

### Placement rules

- Training data → generate on-the-fly in VRAM (never pre-generate to disk)
- Frequently needed → keep in RAM, batch transfers to VRAM
- Control/config → disk OK, but load to RAM for compute
- Large datasets → stream if doesn't fit, minimize disk touches
- Checkpoints, logs/metrics → disk (necessary)

### CPU/GPU split

If compute is CPU-effective + bandwidth available + frees GPU → use CPU + RAM.
- Price generation (SyntheticMarket) → CPU/RAM, transfer to VRAM
- Preprocessing, normalization → CPU while GPU trains
- Oracle path solving (if CPU-bound) → CPU parallel to GPU backward
- Logging, metrics aggregation → CPU (never burn GPU on this)

Goal: keep GPU saturated with gradient compute, offload everything else.

### Anti-patterns (NEVER)

- Pre-generate training data to npz/pkl then load
- Repeated disk reads in training loop
- Intermediate tensors on disk
- Any compute touching disk when RAM/VRAM available

```python
# BAD: disk in the loop
for batch in training_loop:
    data = load_from_disk()
    train_step(data)

# GOOD: on-the-fly in VRAM
for batch in training_loop:
    data = generate_on_the_fly()   # JIT, ~20ms
    train_step(data)

# GOOD: pre-load to RAM, stream to VRAM
data_in_ram = load_once_at_startup()
for batch in training_loop:
    batch = data_in_ram[idx]
    train_step(batch)
```

## JAX Pitfalls

- No `jax.lax.cond` inside `vmap` → use `jnp.where`
- Guard division: `jnp.maximum(x, 1e-10)`
- `jnp.where` evaluates both branches
- Use `static_argnames` for configs in JIT
- Dynamic shapes in `lax.scan` → pad to static `max_len`
- Use `threading.RLock()` not `Lock()` for reentrant contexts
- Add `jax.block_until_ready()` before device-to-host transfers

## Naming (Apothecary Theme)

Medicinal plants, not dark — careful work with powerful tools.
- **Poppy**: dreams via MCTS planning
- **Bella**: vision of unseen markets (belladonna = eye medicine)
- **Foxglove**: cardiotonic — stabilizing pre-training phase
- **Yarrow**: wound herb — finds and cleans

## Context & Documentation

| Location | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| `lore/notes_YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Session notes — mid-session captures, pre-compact checkpoints, not end-of-day logs | During sessions |
| `tasks/TASK_XXX_*.md` | Feature specs & progress | Per task |
| `docs/` | Research papers, architecture docs, setup guides | Reference |
| Subtree `CLAUDE.md` | Component-specific facts | When component changes |

**Check `lore/` and `tasks/` at session start — do not rely on stale summaries in this file or in memory.**

## Activate

```bash
source trader_env/bin/activate
```

Component-specific commands live in the subtree CLAUDE.md files.
